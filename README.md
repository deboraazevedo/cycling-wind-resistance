# Cycling x Wind Resistance
	
Every cyclist who has ever pedaled into a stiff headwind knows about wind resistance. It's exhausting! In order to move forward, the cyclist must push through the mass of air in front of him/her. And this takes energy.

The idea of this project is to show visually how the wind resistance can impact the cycling activity.

## The dataset:
The dataset consists in a workout history (CSV file) and a Jupyter Notebook to perform the data analysis

### How to use ###

1. Download the *py-exercise-dashboard.ipynb*, *dataSource.xlsx* files and put it in the same folder. 
2. After that, use Jupyter notebook tool and access the directory with the files. Enjoy yourself! :)

### Important ###

To run the heat map, it's necessary to run the following command:

```
jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=10000000
```

This command avoid aborting the heatmap processing, which can happen due to the huge amount of coordenates needed to create the maps.

# Cycling x Wind Resistance
	
Every cyclist who has ever pedaled into a stiff headwind knows about wind resistance. It's exhausting! In order to move forward, the cyclist must push through the mass of air in front of her. This takes energy.

The idea of this project is to show visually how the wind resistance can impact the cycling activity.
